# E-Commerce-App-AWIT-Shop
This project is a comprehensive full-stack web application designed to demonstrate the integration of multiple technologies to deliver a robust and interactive user experience. The application employs the following technologies:

Frontend Technologies:

HTML (HyperText Markup Language): Serves as the foundational building block for structuring the web application's user interface. It defines the layout, content, and elements that users interact with.
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): Adds visual styling to the HTML elements, ensuring an aesthetically pleasing and responsive design. It customizes colors, fonts, layouts, and ensures the application's compatibility across various devices.
Bootstrap: A popular CSS framework used to create responsive and mobile-first designs quickly. It simplifies the development of complex layouts and provides pre-designed components like navigation bars, buttons, forms, and modals.
Thymeleaf: A Java-based server-side template engine that dynamically renders HTML pages. It seamlessly integrates with the backend, enabling the embedding of backend data into the HTML templates, enhancing the user experience by providing real-time updates and dynamic content.
Backend Technology:

Spring Boot: A powerful Java-based framework that simplifies backend development. It provides features like dependency injection, seamless REST API creation, and built-in tools for managing application logic and handling HTTP requests. Spring Boot ensures a secure, scalable, and efficient backend infrastructure.
Database Technology:

MySQL: A reliable and widely used relational database management system employed to store and manage the application's data. MySQL enables efficient querying, data consistency, and seamless integration with the Spring Boot backend for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
Functional Features:
Frontend-Backend Interaction: The application leverages Thymeleaf to dynamically render data from the backend onto the frontend pages, enabling seamless communication between the client and server.
Data Persistence: MySQL serves as the data layer where user information, transactions, or other records are securely stored and managed.
Scalability and Maintenance: The modular design of Spring Boot ensures that the backend is scalable, while Bootstrap and Thymeleaf streamline the development and maintenance of the frontend.
